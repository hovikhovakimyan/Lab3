12:43 AM:
Started the project and hour or two ago
currently it is 12:43am and so far I have managed to finish up most of the stdin portion of the project
i've managed to take in input and convert it to a char* as well as add as many 0s and needed
I coded something that converts the string of bits into decimal and also gets its ascii value
i dont know what man ascii is, and also I'm on windows so my makefile uses windows commands
im currently working on coding the parity part of the output

3:35 AM: 
completely finished the no file input half, used xor for the parity, and used left shifts for the binary conversion, been stuck on converting the file contents into a char* array.
Almost done though, once I figure it out I'll be good to go.

4:30 AM:
Finished it all up and simplified it down a lot, removed unnecessary methods.

Changed my code to meet all the new requirements. Now uses read(), and uses inputs that are stored in argv and no longer prompts user. Also properly prints out ascii values below 32.
