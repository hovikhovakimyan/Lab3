Time and Forking Children

2/28 1:30 Downloaded all the necessary tools. fork() and getppid() were not working on MinGW

2:43 Finished up most of it, Added all the necessary print statements and system calls. Just making sure everythings fine then I will submit

3:13 Third commit finished everything up and tested it, changed the return value of the child process to the correct function.

3:31 Fixed the times command and added busy loops as well as removed unused variables. Don't know what to do with uninitialized struct warning on the tms struct but it doesn't seem like a problem. Final push.
